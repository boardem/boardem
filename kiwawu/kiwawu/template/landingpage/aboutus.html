<p>Board-'Em'- The customizable social media!

What is Board-'Em'?
Board-'Em' is a social media platform. One of our goals is to make it as near a fully customizable as possible. Imagine a facebook profile that you want to set up as a sort of your own YouTube channel. People visiting your "channel" can interact with your videos just as a YouTube channel, but you wont be limited as to what your channel looks like, youll be able to change the header and background color/image. We understand that your average person can't (or won't) code <html> that's why we want Myspace customizability with an ease of use that we hope to deliver with user created, easy to implement <html> templates. Maybe your not a YouTuber and want more of the simple layout of Pinterest? With the ability to create multiple "boards" you can have a Pinterest style board or a Facebook style of board, or maybe even your own unique layout! A scrapbook design with floral print as the background, soft background music, do whatever you like, it's your own piece of internet real estate! Don't want people looking at your board? Or maybe you want only certain people to interact with one of your boards, we will have password protected boards so you can have some privacy with your buddies, or family without the hassle of people you don't know making innapropriate comments or anything. There will be a tool to ban certain users from boards that you moderate. Also the ability to appoint trusted moderators to a board that is maybe too big for you to moderate yourself.
USER PROFILES
Your user profile is basically a hub for your boards and a host of other details: friends, boards that you follow in your collection, details about your own boards (stats). It'll show basic information about yourself, or make yourself anonymous. Board-'Em' is your own social media, use it how you want.
BOARD
We plan to give you your first board to get you used to the whole process. Each user can have an unlimited amount of board that other users can see or intereact with or not depending on your wants or needs. We plan to have password protected boards so that only the boards creator and only those he/she would like to enter. Every user will have his own 'collection' of boards that he/she follows, we also plan to allow users to designate boards to list for organization. We would also like to add a feature to toggle the analytics of each of your own boards, so you can view those boards statistics if you so choose.




Why should you choose Board-'Em'?
You should choose Board-'Em' because of its customisabilty over all. Your boards can be a manifestation of of your personality, or they can be used as a tool for communication with friends or family. Get creative and it could easily be both! With Board-'Em' we want to see the people to develop there own social media, there own forms of communication.
